            <h2>Article I</h2>
                <h3>Section 1</h3>
					<p>The legistlative powers in the United States is bestowed upon 2 groups: The Senate and The House of Representatives. 
						Both powers serve as the foundation for the federal government and the lawaking powers in United States</p>
                <h3>Section 2</h3>
                    <p>Every 2 years the people of many states will vote on who will represent their respective states in the House of Representatives. The people themselves have control over who they want to represent and make decisions for them in Congress. 
					<p>The prerequisites for being a member of the House of Representatives is that one must be a U.S. citizen for at least 7 years and be at least 25 years old.</p>
                    <p>Representation in The House of Representatives is dependent on the population of each state every 10 years. The number of representatives is 1 out of 30,000 people and each state will have at least 1 representatives
					  There are exceptions in the case of New Hampshire (3 representatives), Massachusetts (8), Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1), Connecticut (5), New York (6), New Jersey (4), Pennsylvania (8), Deleware (1), Maryland (6),
					  Virginia (10), North Carolina (5), South Carolina (5), and Georgia (3). 
                    </p>
					<p>When there are vacancies in states, the respective governer has the power to call for an election to fill the spot in.</p>
					<p>The House of Representatives themselves choose their own spokeperson (Speaker of the House) as well as other officers; this is encoupled with the ability to enact impeachment should
						such circumstances arise</p>
                <h3>Section 3</h3>
					<p>The Senate contains 2 senators from each state (chosen by state legislatures), each of which lasts for 6 years and has 1 vote. 
						(The 17th amendment supersedes this clause by establishing direct popular election for senators in each state)</p>
                    <p>One third of the Senate’s seats are up to be for election every 2 years, ensuring that the Senate is a continuous body and that all senators will not face election. If there are vacancies in the Senate there will be a temporary senator appointed until the next meeting of the Legislature.
						However, the 17th amendment now states that any Senate vacancy is to be filled by an election called by the state’s governor.</p>
                    <p>To be a senator, one must be a U.S. citizen for at least 9 years and a resident of the state they choose to represent.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President of the United States is the President of the Senate but does not have a vote in regards to decisions made unless the Senate is equally divided.</p>
                    <p>When the Vice President is absent a temporary “President of the Senate” is appointed in addition to the Senate having the power to choose their other offices.</p>
                    <p>If the House of Representatives chooses to impeach an officer, the Senate is the one who votes and makes the final decision on the matter. If two-thirds of senators vote to convict, the individual charged is removed from office.</p>
                    <p>In cases of impeachment, the Senate is only allowed to remove an individual from office and future government services. Beyond that however, regular courts can choose to press charges.</p>
                <h3>Section 4</h3>
                    <p>The location, time, and way elections are held for senators and house representatives are determined by the states themselves. However, Congress holds the power to alter these regulations.</p>
                    <p>Congress is required to meet each year and each time it’s on the first Monday in December unless appointed differently by the law (The 20th amendment moved the day to January 3rd.</p>
                <h3>Section 5</h3>
                    <p>The House of Representatives and Senate are given the power to judge the qualification of their own members and if a Senate election is disputed, the Senate decides who gets a seat. Furthermore, in order for there to be a quorum the major of the Senate must be present.</p>
                    <p>The House of Representatives and Senate have the ability to determine the rules of proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and (if there is a two-third majority agreement) remove a member.</p>
                    <p>The House of Representatives and Senate has to publish an official record of what happens during their proceedings (with certain exceptions in regards to matters that are held to the utmost secrecy).</p>
                    <p>During a Session of Congress, neither the House of Representatives or Senate can adjourn for more than 3 days. This is to prevent one house from obstructing the other’s legislation. </p>
                <h3>Section 6</h3>
                    <p>Congressmen get paid by the government at a salary set by themselves and they cannot be charged with a crime for anything said in Congress nor be arrested by the police unless a serious crime has been committed.</p>
                    <p>No member of the Senate or House of Representatives can serve other branches of the U.S. government. Furthermore, a member of Congress can’t resign from their seat to take another government position if that job has a higher salary during their tenure.</p>
                <h3>Section 7</h3>
                    <p>All bills that raise revenue have to originate from the House of Representatives but the Senate has the power to amend any bill sent to it by the House of Representatives.</p>
					<p>In order for a bill to be passed both the House and Representatives and Senate have to pass it and send it to the president. If the president signs it, then it has become the law. If the president vetoes the bill, the Congress can override his veto with a two-third majority vote. If the president does nothing, the bill becomes a law without his signature after 10 days.</p>
                    <p>Orders, resolutions, and votes made by the Congress are passed under special are sent to the president and make it so that a joint resolution signed by the president is a law.</p>
                <h3>Section 8</h3>
                    <p>The Congress has the power to set and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and exercises to pay debts and maintain the general welfare of those in the United States. Rather than the president who controls money, it is Congress who has that power.</p>
